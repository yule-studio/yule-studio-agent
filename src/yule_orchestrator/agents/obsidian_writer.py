"""Thin file-writer layer for Obsidian notes.

Sits on top of :mod:`yule_orchestrator.agents.obsidian_export` and writes
the rendered :class:`ObsidianNote` content to a real Obsidian vault on
disk. The exporter still owns the contract (frontmatter, body, vault path
shape); this module only handles IO.

Safety guarantees:

- Vault root must be an absolute path that already exists as a directory.
- The resolved file path must remain inside the vault root (no traversal
  via ``..`` or symlinks resolving outside).
- Parent directories are created automatically.
- When the recommended path already exists and ``overwrite`` is False,
  the writer auto-appends ``_2``, ``_3``, ... before the ``.md`` suffix
  inside the same folder so existing notes are never silently clobbered
  and the new write is never silently skipped.
- ``overwrite=True`` keeps the recommended filename and replaces it.
- ``dry_run=True`` performs all checks (including suffix selection) but
  never writes.
