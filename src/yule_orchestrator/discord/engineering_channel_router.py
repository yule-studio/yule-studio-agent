"""Routing logic for the engineering #업무-접수 channel.

The Discord bot's planning conversation layer is preserved as-is; this
router handles the *engineering* path: free conversation in the intake
channel (or a thread under it), and — when the user signals confirmation
— a workflow intake plus a thread kickoff message.

The module is pure-Python: all I/O dependencies (engineering conversation
provider, workflow intake, thread kickoff, message sender) are injected
as callables so unit tests can drive the router without spinning up
discord.py. ``bot.py`` wires the production callables.
